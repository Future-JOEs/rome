## Editor Integration

Rome supports the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implemented by [various editors](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).

When an editor extension is installed, the version of Rome installed into your project will be automatically found and setup. As we improve Rome any changes will automatically work with your editor!

We welcome contributions adding official extensions for other mainstream editors. See [contributing](/contributing) for more information! You can find documentation for the `rome lsp` command that powers the LSP integration [here](/docs/cli/commands/lsp).

- [VSCode](TODO)


Get the most out of Rome by integrating it into with editor. You will get lint errors as you type, and saving will automatically format your files.

Right now Rome only has an official extension for VSCode which you can install [here](TODO) or by searching for "Rome" in the VSCode marketplace.

See [Editor Integration](/docs/editor-integration) for more details.
